=======================
This is a simple PhoneGap application based on Twitter Bootstrap library. It should be ready for _PhoneGap Build_.

This demo contains or includes following things:

* Twitter Bootstrap itself and examples of using it,

* Font Awesome font library along with some cool examples,

* Some examples of using AJAX / JSON calls from PhoneGap application,

* Very cool and superb customizable digital display, purely in Javascript, from [3quarks.com](http://www.3quarks.com/en/SegmentDisplay/index.html),

* Simple theme (stylesheet switcher) allowing dynamic (client-side) look change plus all the free Bootstrap themes / styles from Bootswatch.com.

Use or fork it, if you want to see, how Bootstrap framework works and looks inside a mobile application or if you need a base app for building PhoneGap applications using Bootstrap.
